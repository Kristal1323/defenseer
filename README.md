# DefenSeer
DefenSeer is a smart code-security analysis tool that lets users upload Python scripts, execute them safely in a sandboxed environment, and automatically detect high-impact vulnerabilities using a combination of static analysis, custom rule-matching, and ML-based false-positive filtering.

It acts like a mini secure-IDE: you paste code → it runs → it analyzes → it flags risks → it suggests safer fixes automatically.
